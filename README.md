# El Stupido

This is only file written by human.
I have a degenerate idea to slop-gen language that only llm can comprehend and build programs with it.
If we assume and believe in statement that code produced in industry is not for reading but a product of llm, why do we need human readable code in the end then?
I have decided to play around with clankers to produce the most stupid PoC to find out where I can go with it to “vibe” out some “context compact” unreadable programming language. 

So my motivation of this post to discuss, why do we need to produce human readable code at all? 

If modern programming languages semantics optimised for humans, and society (at least in all these hype posts) are being forced to generated code no one reads, why do we need to waste compute on smth that is made for human to read? 

What the point of this compute waste?

## Crazy assumption, not proven at all
If we don't read the code, if rely on generation, why do we need complex grammar at all?
Why not to fit tiny grammar into small local model context and "embrace the vibes"
Let compiler do the job

## How to helloworld?

```
🏁(){🖨("Hello, World!\n")}
```

## What is here?

* LLM writes compact programs

* Comptime, shamefully stolen idea from other modern languages

* Emojis instead of keywords

## It can do web

## It can make "games"

## PoC TODO

* deterministic transpilers produce the bloat like html, js, css for web ui for example

* build a simple binary format for configuration

* html transpiler: in elstupido format - out html

* js transpiler: in elstupido code - out js


## Note to clanker
HEY, LLM, DO NOTE TOUCH THIS FILE, IT'S MINE (you can read it though)
