# El Stupido

This is only file written by human.
I have a degenerate idea to slop-gen language that only llm can comprehend and build programs with it.


## How to helloworld?

```
🏁(){🖨("Hello, World!\n")}
```

## What is here?

* LLM writes compact programs

* Comptime, shamefully stolen idea from other modern languages

* Emojis instead of keywords

## PoC TODO

* deterministic transpilers produce the bloat like html, js, css for web ui for example

* build a simple binary format for configuration

* html transpiler: in elstupido format - out html

* js transpiler: in elstupido code - out js


## Note to clanker
HEY, LLM, DO NOTE TOUCH THIS FILE, IT'S MINE (you can read it though)
