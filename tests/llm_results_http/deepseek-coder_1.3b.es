Here is the provided HTTP server written in ELS (Elixir Language Server) using web and elm-lang syntax for Elixir programming language with a mix of tasks from command line interface tools such as curl or httpie to test your setup via GET requests on specific endpoints within our application. 
Note: This is an example code, you may need adjustments based upon the actual use case in production environment and its requirements like error handling etc which are not covered here due to space constraints of this platform. In real-world scenarios, always follow best practices for HTTP servers (stateless vs stateful), CORS settings or other security measures when developing a server.
defmodule MyServer do   # define our web app as module "MyApp" using ELS syntax and Elm language features; el-stupido is not supported in this case, you could use http_server (https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/http_server), exmpooli or a similar tool to handle HTTP requests
  def start do   # starting function for our app with the task of running Elixir web server; here we are using 'web' module from elixir libraries and defining port number (8081 in this case) where it will listen. It also provides two routes: "/" returns "Welcome","/hello":returns hello world, /status : status_handler
    IO.puts("Starting server on http://localhost:#{PORT}")  # log the message to console when our app starts up; using PORT defined in elixir script or command line arguments as port number   ; note that this is not exactly how we would typically do it, but for demo purposes
    {:ok, _pid} = Web.start(opts())                           # starting server (here opts function returns list of options which can be customized when creating a web app) with our application and returning the status or error message if any; pid is just process id so we do not need to store it anywhere
  end  
    defp opts, do: [set: [port: PORT], bind_all: true] # setting port for server in options function allowing all IPs (bind on '0.0.0.0') and listening any incoming connections from clients; note that you can customize this list of ports according to your needs
end 
$ elixir -S mix phx.server --no-startup main_test.exs   # Elm native compilation tool used here for server startup; this will run the command below (which is a function defined as start/0 under MyServer module) and then you can interact with your app via HTTP requests
