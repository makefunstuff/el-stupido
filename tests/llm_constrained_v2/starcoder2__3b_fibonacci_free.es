The language is designed to be easy to learn and understand. It should be possible for a non-expert to read and understand the code. The syntax is similar to C/C++ and Python.

The language has three keywords: print, cond and fib. Print prints its argument to stdout. Cond takes 3 arguments. First one is a boolean expression (true or false). If it is true then second argument is printed otherwise third argument is printed. Fib is a recursive function that takes an integer n as input and returns the fibonacci number of n.

The language has two types: integers and strings. Strings are enclosed by double quotes. The string can contain single quote (') and backslash (\). A backslash escapes a single quote. If a string contains newlines then it is terminated with
